# Car Rental Project Summary

This project is a comprehensive car rental platform with three main components:

## Backend (Express.js + MongoDB)

We've implemented a robust backend API with the following features:

- MongoDB schemas for Cars, Bookings, Users, Categories, and Website Info
- JWT-based authentication system with user roles (customer, admin, superadmin)
- RESTful API endpoints for car listing, booking, and user management
- File upload functionality for car images using Multer
- Input validation and error handling

### API Endpoints

- `/api/auth` - Authentication routes (register, login, profile)
- `/api/cars` - Car management routes (listing, filtering, CRUD operations)
- `/api/bookings` - Booking management routes (create, update status, etc.)

## Frontend Client (Next.js)

The client-facing website has been structured with:

- Modern Next.js App Router architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom design system
- Responsive layout for all device sizes
- Key pages implemented:
  - Homepage with featured cars and sections
  - Car listing page with filters
  - Car detail page with specifications and booking form
- Reusable components:
  - Header with navigation
  - Footer with site information
  - CarCard component for consistent car display
- State management ready with Zustand

## Frontend Admin (To be implemented with Materio template)

The admin portal will utilize:

- Materio admin template integration
- Dashboard for monitoring bookings and revenue
- CRUD interfaces for cars, bookings, users and categories
- Role-based access control
